The new website for Darwin Maker Community has been a great chance to learn to use Jekyll to generate static sites and to leverage GitHub tools to provide both a collaboration environment and free hosting. The goal was to create a public page that any community members can edit by raising a pull request. We've had some fantastic talks at Darwin Web Standards and Darwin Hackerspace over the past few years but it is difficult to go back over topics that have been previously covered, hopefully the blog functionality of this site can provide us with an easy repository of past topics. Concequently, a key goal in the development of the site has been to facilitate and encourage collaboration.

This talk will cover the basics of setting up a new Jekyll blog on Github pages and some basic customisation of your new site. We will then look at this particular site in more detail and discuss how you can get involved and contribute.
